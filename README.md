# vb-menu
We are usually asked to create a menu for console applications for school projects and homework.

I got tired writing the same code over and over again so I made this to help reduce the amount\
of code that I need to write and instead allow me to focus on writing the actual functionality of the project.

The `BaseMenu.vb` file contains the abstract class to be imported into a project that requires a menu.\
Examples on how to use it can be found in the `Example Menus` folder.
